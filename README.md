Investigated some data mining techniques includes Naive Bayes, PCA, SVC and the J48 decision tree algorithms. 
Used classification techniques to find the most suitable one for predicting cancer survival rate. 
The Naive Bayes technique depends on the famous Bayesian approach following a clear, simple and fast classifier. It has been called ‘Naive’ due to the fact that it assumes mutually independent attributes. In practice, it is almost never true but is achievable by prepossessing the data to remove the dependent categories. This method has been used in many areas to represent, utilize, and learn the probabilistic knowledge and significant results have been achieved in machine learning.

Another technique we used J48 decision tree. In this study, we build a decision tree according to its gain level and entropy calculation. The root is set based on the higher gain and from this we can also predict rule for our assumption. 

The third technique is the SVC for unsupervised data here we used SVC instead of SVM. This same mechanism as SVM where the data points are mapped from data space to a high dimensional feature space using a kernel function.
Another algorithms we implement here is PCA. Principal component analysis (PCA) is a statistical procedure that uses an orthogonal transformation to convert a set of observations of possibly correlated variables into a set of values of linearly uncorrelated variables called principal components. If there are n observations with p variables, then the number of distinct principal components is min ( n − 1 , p ).

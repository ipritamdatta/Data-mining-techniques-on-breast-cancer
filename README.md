# Data Mining Techniques on Breast Cancer
Apply machine learning on UCI dataset to get prediction model to detect breast cancer is malignant or benign. Each record represents follow-up data for one breast cancer case. These are consecutive patients seen by *Dr. Wolberg* since 1984, and include only those cases exhibiting invasive breast cancer and no evidence of distant metastases at the time of diagnosis.

### Dependencies
* numpy
* sklearn
* matplotlib
* jupyter notebook
* python 2.7
